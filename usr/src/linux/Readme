Kernel config without alien drivers and others unnecessary things. Created for Dell Vostro 15 5568 only.
If you think to try my custom kernel config dont forget that there is no support for bluetooth, webcam and ipv6.
And if you want to have such things working on your laptop you should make necessary changes self or just ask me
what to do.
